# Privacy Policy for Angulus App

<br>

# Introduction
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Statement explains how Angulus collects, uses, and safeguards your information when you use our app or visit our website.

# Data Collection
Angulus respects your privacy and recognizes the importance of protecting your Personal Health Information (PHI). We do not collect or store any user-generated data, measurements, or images on our servers. All measurement activities and images remain solely on your device.

The only data we collect is general, non-identifiable usage information to improve our app and ensure the best possible experience. This data is collected through Google Analytics and may include information such as app usage frequency, feature engagement, and device type. However, this data does not include any personal or identifiable information.

# Use of Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics to gather insights about how users interact with our app. This information helps us improve features, optimize functionality, and better understand our users' needs. Data collected by Google Analytics may include:

- Frequency of app usage
- Device information
- App interaction data

Google Analytics processes this information independently, and it does not allow us to identify individual users. Google Analytics has its own privacy policy and terms of service, which govern its data processing practices.

# User-Generated Data
Angulus is committed to the confidentiality of your data. We understand the sensitivity of PHI and ensure that any images or measurements captured within the app are processed and stored locally on your device only. We do not access, share, or collect any user-generated data for any purpose, respecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your information.

# Data Security
While we do not store any user-generated data on our servers, we are committed to ensuring that any non-identifiable usage data collected through Google Analytics is processed securely. Google implements industry-standard security measures to protect the data it processes on our behalf.

# Third-Party Sharing
Angulus does not share any of your information with third parties, except as outlined for Google Analytics usage data collection. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personal or identifiable information.

# Changes to This Privacy Statement
We may update this Privacy Statement from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review it periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
